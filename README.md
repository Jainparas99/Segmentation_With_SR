**Improving Segementation with Super Resolution**

Introduction :-

In this project I intend to enhance segementation for blurry images and also for animal which get camouflaged easily with their sourroundings making it tough for SAM models to segment them with their background.


Model Setup

The model is setup with an SR model as a wrapper class over the SAM model. This will enhance the image before it get input to the model.
